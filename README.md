FrameWork
=========

this is my own personal beginners framework for 2D games


so in so creating this i will have a youtube chaneel running to display on how to use this framework and create basic ideas in c++ for a game.

1) the first game i will be going through will be pong.
2) after that i will be going through classes.
3) this is also be put up in my blog for anyone who wants to read on how i 
   come along in creating the framework and what else will be included in the framework in a later time 
4) upon creating classes i will go through pointers and moving into more intermediate programming.
5) Thank you for taking the Time to have a look at my framework and have fun creating games with it 
6) My portfolio to my blog is www.tomaszr.com and just click on blog
